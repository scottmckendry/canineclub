      Since starting Canine Club, Rhianna’s sole focus has been to offer owners a safe, fun and  controlled environment for their dogs. With over 7 years in the dog industry, Rhianna is a knowledgeable, experienced handler and has proven herself with a range of breeds. 
      After leaving boarding kennels and doggy daycare behind, she’s found her passion in dog walking and takes pride in returning a tired, happy and fulfilled dog back home. 
      She holds an Animal Management L4 cert, Veterinary Nursing Assistant L5 cert, relevant business insurance and a current Pet First Aid certification.

      2.5yrs old

      Fletcher is our lead dog. He is the dog that will be with Rhianna during assessments and comes to work with her every day. A calm, gentle and friendly boy for new dogs to learn from, and great at helping quiet dogs come out of their shell.

      11 months old

      The newest addition to the management team, Arthur makes his appearances on pack walks occasionally. With most of his training dedicated to making him exceptional in the breed show ring, means that he hasn’t finessed the finer manners needed for pack walking. As he gets older he’ll be with us more frequently, until then he keeps Rhianna very busy during many weekends of dog shows.
