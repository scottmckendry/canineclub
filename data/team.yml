          Fletcher is our lead dog. He is the dog that will be with Rhianna during assessments and comes to work with her every day. 
          A calm, gentle and friendly boy for new dogs to learn from, and great at helping quiet dogs come out of their shell.

          The newest addition to the management team, Arthur makes his appearances on pack walks occasionally. With most of his training dedicated to making him exceptional in the breed show ring, 
          means that he hasn’t finessed the finer manners needed for pack walking. As he gets older he’ll be with us more frequently, until then he keeps Rhianna very busy during many weekends of dog shows.
