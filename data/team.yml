          Arthur, the latest addition to our management team, occasionally joins us on pack walks. Rhianna is kept busy with his participation in many weekend dog conformation shows, travelling up and down the South Island to have as much fun in the ring with him as possible. Arthur enjoys eating bark, annoying his brother and attention from anyone with two legs.
