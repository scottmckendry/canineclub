services_description: "Pack Walks are an adventure for your dog. 1.5-3hours walks in a range of environments. Through rivers, bush, forest trails and city walks, we’ll do it all. We’re all about teaching dogs confidence in new environments and how to handle themselves in high stimulation settings. 

All dogs will receive the training they are required for their walks - a mixture of obedience and leash training. Basic commands such as follow, sit, down, stay, and recall. They are taught to be calm and respectful while on walks, both on and off-lead. 

When adventuring, dogs are kept on lead for several weeks when they start out while they learn the ropes from myself and the other dogs, or if ears switch off. This helps set (or reset) expectations, establish a relationship with the dog, and minimises risk of the dog taking off. 
 
Pack sizes are limited to allow time to work with each dog as needed, and dogs are added in order of best fit and suitability. New dogs are introduced slowly to give them time to find their place - much like first days at a new school. Some take longer than others, and some are better suited moved to a different group, and that's OK. Ultimately it's about what suits both the dog and the pack. 

Currently servicing Rolleston, West Melton & surrounds. If you’re not sure if your area is covered, get in touch! 


How do we get started? 

A free meet and greet gives me a chance to introduce myself and explain what pack walks are all about. During this time I’ll also be able to find out more about your dog and what makes them tick, and suss out if they’ll be a good fit. 

If we’re both happy, we can then progress during the same session to an offsite assessment. This assessment gives me a chance to introduce your dog to the car, work your dog at a local park or quiet area, see what they do/don’t already know and introduce some leash work. 

Before a dog can then join a pack, they’ll require at minimum 2 solo walks with me and my lead dog. The solo walk will be approx 45 minutes and $50. This gives me a chance to really establish a relationship with your dog, show them what I require from them and for them to be able to get a taste of pack walk life before introducing them into a pack."
