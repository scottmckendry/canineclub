services_description: "Experience the thrill of Pack Walks for your canine companion, encompassing invigorating 1.5-3 hour excursions across diverse landscapes, spanning rivers, bushlands, forest trails, and urban settings. 
Our primary focus is instilling confidence in dogs in a range of environments and guiding them to make good choices during high-stimulation scenarios. 
Each dog undergoes tailored training during walks, blending obedience and leash etiquette, encompassing basic commands such as follow, sit, down, stay, and recall. 
We prioristise fostering a calm and respectful demeanor on and off-leash during outings. 
Initially, dogs are kept on leash for several weeks to learn our routine, build a relationship with both myself and fellow pack members, foster clear expectations, gain respect and trust, and eliminate flight risks. 
Pack sizes are deliberately limited to ensure individual attention, with new dogs integrated based on compatibility and suitability.
Currently serving Rolleston, West Melton, and adjacent areas; for inquiries regarding coverage, please reach out. 

Ready to embark on this journey? A complimentary meet-and-greet initiates our interaction, offering insights into Pack Walks and facilitating an understanding of your dog's temperament and preferences to ensure a harmonious fit. Next, an offsite assessment session acquaints your dog with car travel, allows me to assess existing skills, and introduces leash training in a controlled environment. 
Prior to pack integration, dogs undergo a minimum of two solo walks alongside myself and my lead dog, each lasting approximately 45 minutes at a rate of $50 per session. 
This foundational step establishes a relationship, familiarises dogs with expectations, and provides a glimpse into the pack walk experience.

Pack Walks are priced at $45 per session, requiring a weekly commitment.
