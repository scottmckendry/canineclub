    - question: "Do I have to commit to weekly walks?"
      answer: "Indeed, to maintain consistency in training and the stability of the pack, a weekly commitment is mandatory upon signing up."
    - question: "Do you have a cancellation policy?"
      answer: "Yes, any cancellations made on the morning of the walk must be paid in full. However, exceptions will be considered for emergency circumstances. The full cancellation policy can be found on our Services page."
    - question: "Do they need to have any prior training?"
      answer: "No, while a dog that has undergone training is more likely to successfully integrate into the pack faster, ultimately, I am committed to providing all training necessary to ensure the dog becomes a confident member of the pack. It's important to recognize that a dog may exhibit desirable behaviour during walks under my guidance due to the diligent effort invested in training. However, this does not guarantee the same behaviour when handled by others. Should you seek assistance with leash training, I am available to recommend reputable local trainers. Please feel free to reach out for further guidance."
