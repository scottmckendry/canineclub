    - question: "Do they need to have any prior training?"
      answer: "No. While a dog that's had training will likely pass their assessment and slot into the pack easier, at the end of the day I will teach the dog everything they need in order to become a thriving part of the pack. Please note, your dog may walk nicely for me because I've put in the work with them, this does not automatically mean thye'll begin walking nicely for you. If you'd like to be recommended a local trainer to help with leash work, please reach out!"
