## What We Do

I firmly believe that a dogâ€™s world is as big as its owner makes it. Pack walks, with other dogs and a solid relationship with their handler, can provide a safe and engaging way for dogs to explore the finest areas of Canterbury.
Pack walks are the best way to get your dog exercised, socialised, learning great manners and appropriate play. A structured environment to create a happy, balanced dog.
