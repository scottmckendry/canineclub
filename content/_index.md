## What We Do

I’m a big believer in the saying that your dog's world is as big as you choose to make it. Pack walks, with other dogs and a solid relationship with their handler, can be a safe and stimulating way for dogs to get out and explore Selwyn’s finest areas. 
Pack walks are the best way to get your dog exercised, socialised, learning great manners and appropriate play. A structured environment to create a happy, balanced dog.
