## What We Do

A dogâ€™s world is as big as its owner makes it. Pack walks, with other dogs and a solid relationship with their handler, can provide a safe and engaging way for dogs to explore the finest areas of Canterbury.
Pack walks are a great way to get your dog exercised, socialised, learning great manners and appropriate play. We provide a structured environment to create a happy, balanced dog.
